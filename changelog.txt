1.4.0 (2011-10-30)
 * 9 ~ 16 bit-depth input/output
    * Related parameters: input_mode/input_depth/output_mode/output_depth
 * New random number generator, reference position and dither noise can be 
   generated in uniform or gaussian distribution
    * Related parameters: random_algo_ref / random_algo_dither
 * diff_seed is replaced with dynamic_dither_noise, when enabled, noise pattern
   will be different for each frame
 * Another new parameter: enable_fast_skip_plane
 * Short filter alias: f3kdb
 * Now the ICC-compiled DLL should be runnable on pre-SSE2 systems (untested)
 * Several bug fixes

1.3.0 (2011-09-07)
 * Added x64 version
 * Added a downsample filter: f3kdb_dither
 * Internal precision is increased to 16bit
 * New parameter: keep_tv_range, please see readme.txt for details
 * Default sample_mode is changed to 2 as it is better in most cases
 * Fixed: Floyd-Steinberg dithering may produce incorrect result for full-range 
          videos
 * Fixed: Broken YUY2 debanding
 * Minor optimizations
  
1.2.0 (2011-08-01)
 * Added support for YUY2 (not optimized yet)
 * Added support for all planar YUV format in AviSynth 2.6
 * The filter is now compatible with both AviSynth 2.5 and 2.6
 * 16bit output (precision_mode = 4/5)
   * Note: The internal processing precision is still 14bit, this will be
     improved in future versions
 
1.1.0 (2011-06-18)
 * Fixed a bug that high threshold values would produce incorrect result in
   high precision modes.
 * Threshold values was scaled based on other parameter in previous versions, 
   it is unscaled now to increase flexibility. Using same value has weaker 
   effect in new version. Effect of default parameter set is also changed. 
 * SSE optimization for high precision mode.
 * Rejects some invalid parameter combination instead of silently skips them

1.0.2 (2011-06-06)
 * High precision mode 
 *  * (currently non-optimized, SSE routine will be added later)
 * Frame edges are properly processed now
 * Fix crash in some cases (unaligned frames are handled correctly)
 * Other bug fixes

1.0.1 (2011-05-27)
 * Multi-threaded processing
 * Skip planes which threshold is 0
 * 
1.0.0 (2011-05-21)
 * Lots of bug fix
 * SSE optimization, massive speed up

0.9.1 (2011-05-05)
 * Fix: Incorrect results when blur_first=true

0.9 (2011-05-04)
 * Initial release
